# angular-python-mongo

AWS ECS Docker containerized Flask based RESTful full stack web Application for CITY INFORMATION, implemented using Python, AngularJS, HTML, JSON, MongoDB(PyMongo) and Docker. Deployed application using AWS ECS conatiner services, ran the instances using AWS EC2 instance.
Contains support for API Versioning, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

Full stack Web - live application:  ( http://ec2-3-17-134-171.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:1111 )
Flask-backend :  ( http://ec2-3-17-134-171.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8001/todo/api/v1.0/cities/ )


# COMPONENTS: 

# Docker : Build once, Run anywhere is the basic principle, hence Docker! 
		
		 NOTE :  In the file docker-compose.yml, port is to which angular-client("1111:80") on nginx server, 
		 		 flask-server("8001:90" ) on Flask server listen are different
		 		
		 	Separate DockerFile in each directory for :

		 	1. AngularJS Client its app/angular-client/static/Dockerfile  
		 	2. Python flask-server backend its app/flask-server/Dockerfile

 
# Front End : AngularJS based (CityApp) code supporting CRUD operations for Cities (inside the directory angular-client/), 
			
			1. HTML file located in app/angular-client/static/index.html, has CSS code embedded in it .
			   Running front end app on nginx server.

			2. app/angular-client/static/js/controllersCityAppController.js  :
               AngularJs Controller code calling factory service CityFactoryAPI (residing inside CityService.js) 	                     

			3. app/angular-client/static/js/CityService.js : 
			   contains factory service CityFactoryAPI for creating AngularJs services. It also has REST API HTTP URLs, it then talks to flask-server   


			UI TESTING :

			Karma Test runner file in the directory app/angular-client/static/tests/karma.conf.js 

			UI TEST CASES : 

			inside  app/angular-client/static/tests/units : 

			Two Test cases written namely :

				 1. testingCityAppControllerUnitSpec.js for the Controller CityAppController.js 
				 2. testingCityServiceUnitSpec.js  for the Service CityService.js 

				 How to Run :

				 goto directory app/angular-client/static/tests

				 1. type "karma start karma.conf.js"  to run the karma test runner  


				 Sample Code Coverage report after running karma test runner :

				 .
					PhantomJS 2.1.1 (Mac OS X 0.0.0): Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0.111 secs / 0.032 secs)

# Flask:    For running flask application one needs requirements.txt file, it is residing in the directory app/flask-server 	


# BackEnd :  Python Flask based Python file residing in directory :  app/flask-server/app.py 

			 1. Has support for RESTful APIs for CRUD functionality, connected to a remote MongoDB Olap database server, 
			 2. every REST API method has support of CORS enabled methods(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)  is a mechanism 
			 	which uses additional HTTP headers to let a user agent gain permission to access selected resources from  a  server 
			 	on a different origin (domain) than the site currently in use)
			 3. used PyMongo library for communicating with  the MongoDB database.

# Database : 
           MongoDB as a database to store basic City Information, used a reomte database, 
		   embedded the URI link inside the flask Python code, situated in mLAB distributed MongoDB server.

# AWS ECS Container Services :
		   Deployed the docker containers into AWS cloud using ECS container services, ran the instances using AWS EC2 service.Created security groups for each service component. 	


# how to run using docker into the local environment using localhost

1. goto directory angularjs-python-mongo under your directory
2. Next task is to run angular-js-client and flask-service using docker
2. type in terminal :  docker-compose build
3. type in terminal:  docker-compose up 
4. Now both Client(nginx for UI) and backend servers (Flask sever )
5. Open browser type "http://localhost:1111/" to run nginx server for client application (user interface for CITIES App built with angular-js)
6. To check JSON data using flask-server (backend application in python) type "http://0.0.0.0:8001/todo/api/v1.0/cities" (one can test the back-end app using POSTMAN tool to check health of RESTful API )
